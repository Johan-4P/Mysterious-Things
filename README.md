## Design

### Color Scheme 
I have chose the color based on the mystical theme that the page is build on.

In my css file i have mostly used variables to declare color, and used these throughout the css file.
its useful to ise the same color code if you wish to alter the color on the webpage.
* I have used #d13333 & #ecbdbd as the primary and secondary color used for the sites text.
* I have used gradient-bg: linear-gradient
    90deg,
    rgba(101, 43, 76, 1) 51%,
    rgba(2, 0, 36, 1) 100%,
    rgba(0, 212, 255, 1) 100%
as the background-color.
* I have used background-color: #01060a as background-color.
* I have used #d13333 as the border color.

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for the site.
* For almost all text i used the google font [Delius](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Delius?preview.text=Mysterious%20Things)
