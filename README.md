## Design

### Color Scheme 
I have chose the color based on the mystical theme that the page is build on.

In my css file i have mostly used variables to declare color, and used these throughout the css file.
its useful to ise the same color code if you wish to alter the color on the webpage.
* I have used #f38609 & #ffffff as the primary and secondary color used for the sites text.
* I have used gradient-bg: linear-gradient
    90deg,
    rgba(101, 43, 76, 1) 51%,
    rgba(2, 0, 36, 1) 100%,
    rgba(0, 212, 255, 1) 100%
as the background-color.
* I have used text-shadow: 1px 1px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7) as text-shadow.
* I have used #ffffff as the border color.
