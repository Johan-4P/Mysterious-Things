                <p>In some modern pagan traditions, divination is done by
                    Casting runes. Much like reading Tarot cards, rune casting isn’t
                    Fortune-telling or predicting the future.</p>
                <p>Instead it’s a guidance tool.
                    Runes won’t give exact answers, like what day you’ll die or
                    The name of the person you’re going to marry.</p>

                <p>Norse legend,
                    the runic alphabet was discovered by Odin himself,
                    and so the runes are more than just a collection of symbols
                    Of great universal forces, and the gods themselves.</p>
